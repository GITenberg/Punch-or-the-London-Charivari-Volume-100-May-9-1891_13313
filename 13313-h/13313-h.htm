    <h2>A FIRST VISIT TO THE "NAVERIES."</h2>

    <p>"Shiver my timbers!" said the Scribe.</p>

    <p>"Haul down my yard-arm with a marling-spike!" cried the
    Artist.</p>

    <p>And with these strictly nautical expressions, two of <i>Mr.
    Punch's</i> Own entered the Royal Naval Exhibition, which now
    occupies the larger portion of the grounds of the Military
    Hospital, Chelsea. That so popular a show should be allowed to
    occupy so large a site speaks wonders for the amiability of the
    British Public. When the Sodgeries appeared last year, it was,
    so to speak, with fear and trembling that "the powers that
    were" appropriated a little of the ground usually over-run by
    the Nobility and Gentry of the Pimlico Road and its vicinity;
    or, rather, by their haughty offspring. This year the tough old
    sea-dogs of the Admiralty have had no hesitation in taking what
    they required, apparently without causing comment, much less
    objection. And the result? In lieu of the dusty arena of 1890,
    scarcely large enough for a ladies' cricket-match, there
    appears in 1891 an enclosure containing lakes and lighthouses,
    panoramas, and full-size models of men-of-war! And the Public
    take their exclusion philosophically, either paying their
    shillings at the door, or attempting to get a view of the hoofs
    of the nautical horses through the gaps in the surrounding
    hoardings.</p>

    <p>The Scribe and the Artist, having been ordered by He Who
    Must Be Obeyed in the world generally, and at 85, Fleet Street,
    in particular, to make a sort of preliminary cruise through the
    wonders of the (Admiralty) Deep, hastened from the inviting
    grounds into the main building, with its pictures, its plans,
    and last, but (it is only just to say) least, its pickles. The
    first object that attracted their favourable attention was a
    trophy of arms, representing the fashions of the past and the
    present. On one side were shrapnel and magazine rifles, on the
    other flint-locks and the ordnance of an age long gone by. Next
    they passed through the Arctic section, wherein they found
    dummies drawing a sledge through the canvas snow of a
    corded-off North Pole. Then they entered the Picture Galleries
    called after NELSON and BENBOW, wherein magnificent paintings
    by POWELL, full of smoke and action, served as an appropriate
    background to the collection of plate, lent by that gallant
    sailor-warrior and industrious collector of well-considered
    trifles, H.R.H. the Duke of EDINBURGH. They glanced at the
    relics of Trafalgar, and then hurried away to the HOWE Gallery,
    which, containing as it did specimens of the implements used in
    the game of golf, might have as appropriately been christened
    the WHEREFORE. Next they skirted a corridor full of plans, and
    here they discovered that the Committee of the Exhibition must
    be wags, every Jack Tar of them! This corridor was close to the
    Dining-rooms, and the Committee (ha! ha! ha!) had called it
    (he! he! he!) after COOK! (Ho! ho! ho!) Oh, the wit of it! How
    the Members of the Executive must have nudged one another in
    the ribs as the quaint idea dawned upon them! And how they must
    have laughed, too, on the Opening Day, when the Guard of
    Honour, presenting arms, and the "Greenwich Boys" singing
    "<i>Ye Mariners of England</i>," were drenched in the rain! And
    what a capital notion it was on that occasion to put "the
    Representatives of the Fourth Estate" (no doubt called by
    <i>them</i>, with many a sly twinkle of the eye, "the Press
    Gang") into a pen that soon, thanks to a series of
    water-spouts, assumed the appearance of a tank!</p>

    <p>After leaving the Galleries, the Scribe and the Artist
    looked up at the model of Eddystone Lighthouse, and entered a
    shed declared to be an "Arctic Scene." Here they were reminded
    by the introduced ship of those happy days of their boyhood
    spent in the toy-shops of the Lowther Arcade. Next they visited
    the Panorama of Trafalgar, and revelled in the carnage of a
    sea-fight that only required Margate in the distance to be
    entirely convincing. They glanced at the arena, and gazed with
    awe at the lake which is to be devoted to the manoeuvring of
    miniature ironclads. It will be interesting to note whether
    these mimic combats will hold their own in the coming season
    against the introduction of capsized clowns, drenched old
    women, and comic police. Keeping the best for the last, the
    Scribe and the Artist now entered the model of the
    <i>Victory</i>&mdash;a really admirable exhibition. There they
    saw before them the old battle-ship with its full equipment, as
    it was in the days of NELSON&mdash;when that deathless hero
    expected every Englishman (not excluding even those passing the
    Custom House&mdash;as the Committee would say) "to <i>do</i>
    his duty." To make the illusion complete, the great sea-captain
    was observed dying in the cook-pit in the agonies of wax. And
    to think that this work was executed by a firm of
    house-decorators! Why, who would not, after this, have his back
    drawing-room converted into the quarter-deck of the
    <i>Shannon</i>, and his spare bed-room into a tiny reproduction
    of the Battle of Copenhagen!</p>

        </a>Mr. Punch's Representatives, after partaking of Chelsea
        Hospitality (<i>a purely fancy sketch</i>).
    </div>

    <p>The Scribe and the Artist, on their visit, were invited by
    all sorts and conditions of men to partake of champagne. The
    moment it was discovered that they were "connected with the
    Press," the offerers of hospitality were absolutely
    overwhelming. But, obeying the best traditions of their order,
    they sternly, but courteously, refused all refreshment. It is
    fortunate they pursued this course, for had they received the
    entirely disinterested kindness of their would-be hosts, their
    recollections of the marvels of the Royal Naval Exhibition
    would no doubt have been of the haziest character imaginable.
    As it was, they were able to take their departure through the
    main entrance with some show of dignity, and not in a less
    imposing manner (as the Committee&mdash;<i>Cook's</i> Gallery
    near the Dining-rooms&mdash;ho! ho! ho! ha! ha! ha!&mdash;would
    probably and amusingly suggest), by Tite Street.</p>
    <hr />

    <h3>AMONG THE IMMORTALS.</h3>

    <p>Mr. PUNCH would be failing in his duty to Art and the
    British Public if he did not place on imperishable record his
    notes of the exceptionally brilliant Royal Academy Banquet of
    last Saturday. H.R.H. the Prince of WALES made one of his best
    and briefest speeches, in which he feelingly alluded to the
    late Sir EDGAR BO&Euml;HM, R.A. Never was the President, Sir
    FREDERICK, more eloquent, or his themes more varied; for this
    occasion is noteworthy as being the first time in the history
    of this great annual representative gathering that the toast of
    Music and the Drama has been duly honoured. Sir ARTHUR SULLIVAN
    responded for the first, and HENRY IRVING for the second. Both
    made excellent speeches. Sir ARTHUR'S solo was most effective;
    his notes were in his head; he gave us several variations on
    the original theme, and cleverly played upon one word in saying
    that music had been "instrumental" on various historical
    occasions. HENRY IRVING followed suit; he spoke of Mrs.
    SIDDONS, Sir JOSHUA REYNOLDS, and of a professional gentleman,
    one ROSCIUS, mentioned, we believe, by <i>Hamlet</i> as having
    been, some considerable time ago, "a man of parts," that is an
    Actor, in Rome. It was a great success. Sir FREDERICK then
    proposed the LORD MAYOR, which may be briefly expressed as "a
    toast with a Savory to follow." For "The Visitors," Lord
    Justice BOWEN, catching sight of the President's classical
    picture (No. 232), made a happy hit about the delights of a
    honeymoon in the Infernal Regions, ending in the return of
    Proserpine to her mother Ceres by order of the Court above.
    Finally, the President, in summing up the losses to Art during
    the past year, paid a graceful tribute to the memory of CHARLES
    KEENE, who, but a short while ago, was our fellow-worker on the
    staff of <i>Mr. Punch</i> With a hopeful allusion to the
    Storage of Artistic Force in the near future, the President
    concluded: but this Banquet of 1891 will long live in the
    recollection of all whose privilege it was to be present on so
    memorable an occasion.</p>
    <hr />

    <h3>MUSICAL NOTES.</h3>

    <p>I SAY! YSAYE! <i>Why say?</i> Why <i>not</i> say that YSAYE
    is a grand Yolinist, since he is this; and, as 'ARRY would
    observe, "No error!" and whoever says the contrary, is not
    speaking the absolute truth, but "<i>Ysaye Worsay</i>." The
    Yolinist had the advantage of the co-operation of a fine
    Orchestra, under the Magic Wand of Conductor COWEN.</p>

    <p>On the 27th, Heard young JEAN GERARDY, Little boy, but
    player hardy, Not the slightest Lardy-Dardy, Not yet out of
    care of "Guardy," Heard him <i>Lundi</i>, not on <i>Mardi</i>.
    But, whene'er he plays, your Bardy, Always spry, and never
    tardy, Will again hear JEAN GERARDY.</p>

    <p class="center">No. III.&mdash;HEDDA GABLER.</p>

    <p class="center">ACT. III.</p>

    <p class="scene">SCENE.&mdash;<i>The same Room, but&mdash;it
    being evening&mdash;darker than ever&mdash;The crape curtains
    are drawn. A Servant, with black ribbons in her cap, and red
    eyes, comes in and lights the gas quietly and carefully. Chords
    are heard on the piano in the back Drawing-room. Presently</i>
    HEDDA <i>comes in and looks out into the darkness. A short
    pause. Enter</i> GEORGE TESMAN.</p>

    <p><i>George</i>. I am <i>so</i> uneasy about poor
    L&Ouml;VBORG. Fancy! he is not at home. Mrs. ELVSTED told me he
    had been here early this morning, so I suppose you gave him
    back his manuscript, eh?</p>

    <p><i>Hedda</i> (<i>cold and immovable, supported by
    arm-chair</i>). No, I put it on the fire instead.</p>

    <p><i>George</i>. On the fire! L&Ouml;VBORG'S wonderful new
    book that he read to me at BRACK'S party, when we had that wild
    revelry last night! Fancy <i>that!</i> But, I say,
    HEDDA&mdash;isn't that <i>rather</i>&mdash;eh? <i>Too</i> bad,
    you know&mdash;really. A great work like that. How on earth did
    you come to think of it?</p>

    <p><i>Hedda</i> (<i>suppressing an almost imperceptible
    smile</i>). Well, dear GEORGE, you gave me a tolerably strong
    hint.</p>

    <p><i>George</i>. Me? Well, to be sure&mdash;that <i>is</i> a
    joke! Why, I only said that I envied him for writing such a
    book, and it would put me entirely in the shade if it came out,
    and if anything was to happen to it, I should never forgive
    myself, as poor L&Ouml;VBORG couldn't write it all over again,
    and so we must take the greatest care of it! And then I left it
    on a chair and went away&mdash;that was all! And you went and
    burnt the book all up! Bless me, who <i>would</i> have expected
    it?</p>

    <p><i>Hedda</i>. Nobody, you dear simple old soul! But I did it
    for your sake&mdash;it was <i>love</i>, GEORGE!</p>

    <p><i>George</i> (<i>in an outburst between doubt and joy</i>).
    HEDDA, you don't mean that! Your love takes such queer forms
    sometimes, Yes, but yes&mdash;(<i>laughing in excess of
    joy</i>), why, you <i>must</i> be fond of me! Just think of
    that now! Well, you <i>are</i> fun, HEDDA! Look here, I must
    just run and tell the housemaid that&mdash;she will enjoy the
    joke so, eh?</p>

    <p><i>Hedda</i> (<i>coldly, in self-command</i>). It is surely
    not necessary, even for a clever Norwegian man of letters in a
    realistic social drama, to make quite such a fool of himself as
    all that?</p>

    <p><i>George</i>. No, that's true too. Perhaps we'd better keep
    it quiet&mdash;though I <i>must</i> tell Aunt JULIE&mdash;it
    will make her so happy to hear that you burnt a manuscript on
    my account! And, besides, I should like to ask her whether
    that's a usual thing with young wives. (<i>Looks uneasy and
    pensive again.</i>) But poor old EJLERT'S manuscript! Oh Lor,
    you know! Well, well! [Mrs. ELVSTED <i>comes in</i>.</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. E.</i> Oh, please, I'm so uneasy about dear Mr.
    L&Ouml;VBORG. Something has happened to him, I'm sure!</p>

    <p><i>Judge Brack</i> (<i>comes in from the hall, with a new
    hat in his hand</i>). You have guessed it, first time.
    Something <i>has!</i></p>

    <p><i>Mrs. E.</i> Oh, dear, good gracious! What is it?
    Something distressing, I'm certain of it! [<i>d.</i></p>

    <p><i>Brack</i> (<i>pleasantly</i>). That depends on how one
    takes it. He has shot himself, and is in a hospital now, that's
    all!</p>

    <p><i>George</i> (<i>sympathetically</i>). That's sad, eh? poor
    old L&Ouml;VBORG! Well, I <i>am</i> cut up to hear that. Fancy,
    though, eh?</p>

    <p><i>Hedda</i>. Was it through the temple, or through the
    breast? The breast? Well, one can do it beautifully through the
    breast, too. Do you know, as an advanced woman, I like an act
    of that sort&mdash;it's so positive, to have the courage to
    settle the account with himself&mdash;it's beautiful,
    really!</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. E.</i> Oh, HEDDA, what an odd way to look at it! But
    never mind poor dear Mr. L&Ouml;VBORG now. What <i>we've</i>
    got to do is to see if we can't put his wonderful manuscript,
    that he said he had torn to pieces, together again. (<i>Takes a
    bundle of small pages out of the pocket of her mantle.</i>)
    There are the loose scraps he dictated it to me from. I hid
    them on the chance of some such emergency. And if dear Mr.
    TESMAN and I were to put our heads together, I <i>do</i> think
    something might come of it.</p>

    <p><i>George</i>. Fancy! I will dedicate my life&mdash;or all I
    can spare of it&mdash;to the task. I seem to feel I owe him
    some slight amends, perhaps. No use crying over spilt milk, eh,
    Mrs. ELVSTED? We'll sit down&mdash;just you and I&mdash;in the
    back drawing-room, and see if you can't inspire me as you did
    him, eh?</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. E.</i> Oh, goodness, yes! I should like it&mdash;if
    it only might be possible!</p>

    <p class="bracket">[GEORGE <i>and</i> Mrs. E. <i>go into the
    back Drawing-room and become absorbed in eager
    conversation</i>; HEDDA <i>sits in a chair in the front room,
    and a little later</i> BRACK <i>crosses over to her.</i></p>

    <p><i>Hedda</i> (<i>in a low tone</i>). Oh, Judge, <i>what</i>
    a relief to know that everything&mdash;including L&Ouml;VBORG'S
    pistol&mdash;went off so well! In the breast! Isn't there a
    veil of unintentional beauty in that? Such an act of voluntary
    courage, too!</p>

    <p><i>Brack</i> (<i>smiles</i>). Hm!&mdash;perhaps, dear Mrs.
    HEDDA&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>Hedda</i> (<i>enthusiastically</i>). But <i>wasn't</i> it
    sweet of him! To have the courage to live his own life after
    his own fashion&mdash;to break away from the banquet of
    life&mdash;<i>so</i> early and <i>so</i> drunk! A beautiful act
    like that <i>does</i> appeal to a superior woman's
    imagination!</p>

    <p><i>Brack</i>. Sorry to shatter your poetical illusions,
    little Mrs. HEDDA, but, as a matter of fact, our lamented
    friend met his end under other circumstances. The shot did
    <i>not</i> strike him in the <i>breast</i>&mdash;but&mdash;
    [<i>Pauses.</i></p>

    <p><i>Hedda</i> (<i>excitedly</i>). General GABLER'S pistols! I
    might have known it! Did they <i>ever</i> shoot straight? Where
    <i>was</i> he hit, then?</p>

    <p><i>Brack</i> (<i>in a discreet undertone</i>). A little
    lower down!</p>

    <p><i>Hedda</i>. Oh, <i>how</i> disgusting!&mdash;how
    vulgar!&mdash;how ridiculous!&mdash;like everything else about
    me!</p>

    <p><i>Brack</i>. Yes, we're realistic types of human nature,
    and all that&mdash;but a trifle squalid, perhaps. And why did
    you give L&Ouml;VBORG your pistol, when it was certain to be
    traced by the police? For a charming cold-blooded woman with a
    clear head and no scruples, wasn't it just a leetle
    foolish?</p>

    <p><i>Hedda</i>. Perhaps; but I wanted him to do it
    beautifully, and he didn't! Oh, I've just admitted that I
    <i>did</i> give him the pistol&mdash;how annoyingly unwise of
    me! Now I'm in <i>your</i> power, I suppose?</p>

    <p><i>Brack</i>. Precisely&mdash;for some reason it's not easy
    to understand. But it's inevitable, and you know how you dread
    anything approaching scandal. All your past proceedings show
    that. (<i>To</i> GEORGE <i>and</i> Mrs. E., <i>who come in
    together from the back-room.</i>) Well, how are you getting on
    with the reconstruction of poor L&Ouml;VBORG'S great work,
    eh?</p>

    <p><i>George</i>. Capitally; we've made out the first two parts
    already. And really, HEDDA, I do believe Mrs. ELVSTED <i>is</i>
    inspiring me; I begin to feel it coming on. Fancy that!</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. E.</i> Yes, goodness! HEDDA, <i>won't</i> it be

    <p><i>Monday.&mdash;Le Proph&ecirc;te</i>.&mdash;Notable
    performance. Profit to those who were there; loss to those who
    weren't. The two Poles, NED and JOHN DE RESZK&Eacute;,
    excellent as the Tipster, or Prophet, and the Chief Anabaptist
    Swindler. Madame RICHARD&mdash;"<i>O Richard, Oma Reine!</i>"
    repeated her grand impersonation of <i>Fides</i>, but being a
    trifle "out of it" as to tune occasionally, I cannot be
    <i>Fidei Defensor</i>, and swear she was quite correct, so can
    only report that RICHARD was a bit "dicky"; otherwise, sings
    like a Dicky-Bird. Cathedral Scene magnificent. Rites are
    wrong, probably; but these are trifles, except to strict
    ritualists. Skating Scene not up to date; it was a novelty once
    upon a time, but rinks have done for it. There was an
    unrehearsed effect in the Prison Scene, when the walls
    collapsed&mdash;the imprisoned Madame RICHARD escaped, and the
    Curtain descended. Nobody hurt. The walls, which had fallen,
    like those of Jericho, to the sound of the trumpet, were put
    away carefully, for alteration and repairs. The prisoner,
    issuing from her narrow fire-escape, was recaptured, and the
    Opera ended with the Drinking Scene, the Prophet among the
    Peris, a peri-lous situation, which makes the Opera go, at the
    climax, "like a house-a-fire." Burns Justice is done to the
    Impostor, and, at a late hour, we call our cabs, and return to
    hum "<i>b&eacute;viam</i>" over "a modest quencher."</p>

    <p><i>Saturday</i>.&mdash;BO&Iuml;TO'S <i>Mefistofele</i>.
    Strong combination. Excellent. But big "waits" made it

    have a shy at its little go? Examine this, and say all you know
    about "PIERS, or PEARS, the Ploughman." Did he use his own
    soap?</p>

    <p>2. How do you extract the square of a Beet-root? In
    connection with this, say how much it will take to square a
    "Swede?"</p>

    <p>3. Explain the use of the "Sewing-machine" for agricultural
    purposes. What do you mean by "going against the grain?"</p>

    <p>4. You plant a field of corn. What plaster do you adopt when
    it begins to shoot? Also give the best remedy you know for
    <i>corn in the ear</i>.</p>

    <p>5. Write a Sentimental History of the Harvest Moon. Is it
    really twice as big as any other moon, or does it only look so,
    after drinking the landlord's health several times over?</p>

    <p>6. To what <i>gourmet</i> giving a dinner-party in January
    is attributed the historical saying, "<i>Peas</i> at any
    price"?</p>

    <p>7. How many black beans will make five white ones? Given the
    number, explain the process, and solve the equation.</p>

    <p>8. What pomade do you recommend for "top-dressing"?</p>

    <p>9. What would be an M.P.'s first step towards squaring a
    circle of Agricultural Voters?</p>

    <h3>REPARTEE TO A SPOUSE.</h3>

    <p>Both parties in the recent extraordinary abduction case,
    where a Mrs. JONES was carried off down a rope-ladder at
    midnight by her own husband, Mr. JONES, have published
    statements defending their own line of conduct. The following
    is Mrs. JONES'S version:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"As public opinion appears to have erroneously taken
    my&mdash;so-called&mdash;husband's side, as far as I can gather
    from my having been twice chased through the streets by an
    infuriated mob, and four separate attempts having been made to
    blow up my house with nitro-glycerine, I feel compelled to
    explain&mdash;with much reluctance&mdash;why it was that I
    declined to live with Mr. JONES.</p>

    <p>"To begin with, it was only under <i>the most awful
    threats</i> that Mr. JONES prevailed on me to become his wife.
    His words&mdash;I remember them well&mdash;were, 'My darling,
    you know how tenderly I adore you; if you don't marry me <i>at
    once</i> I'll break every bone in your body!' He then snatched
    my bonnet, a <i>new one</i>, from my head, and so acted on my
    <i>nerves</i> that I went off to the Registry Office and was
    married. That he was actuated by merely mercenary motives is
    proved by the fact that the gratuity (of half-a-crown), which
    he presented to the Registry Clerk, he actually <i>borrowed
    from me!</i> I knew him already to be unprincipled; but never
    until that moment had it flashed upon me that he was a
    <i>fortune-hunter!</i> However, as he had the drawing-room
    poker with him&mdash;he kept it concealed up his back during
    the ceremony at the Registry Office&mdash;I did not at that
    time say anything, but handed him the coin. I do not know if I
    should have left him at once, had he not aggravated the
    baseness of his conduct by using the vulgar expression, 'Fork
    it out quick!' But I regret to say that his origin is painfully
    <i>low</i>. Whereas, anybody who consults <i>my</i> relatives
    will hear from them that they belong to the very highest County
    Families. Indeed, he would hear it all day long if he lived
    with them, as I do!</p>

    <p>"On the day of the abduction, I was treated
    <i>barbarously!</i> Even the cab in which I was taken off was,
    so the coachman informed me, 'put down to my account.' Oh, had
    I but guessed the truth about Mr. JONES when I went to the
    Altar&mdash;I mean the Registry Office! Supper consisted of
    <i>cold mutton and pickles</i> (!) which latter he upset, and I
    had a dress <i>ruined</i>."</p>

    <p>On perusing the above, Mr. JONES decided that he could no
    longer keep silence, and has made public the subjoined
    explanation:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"When I first saw Mrs. JONES&mdash;then Miss
    THOMPSON&mdash;her youthful grace quite captivated me. Her age
    was under fifty-six, and mine was just sixty. She was, in fact,
    as I told her at the time, almost old enough to know her own
    mind. It is true that she was wealthy, but that had no
    influence on my conduct. On the contrary I felt it as a
    positive drawback, as my domestic ideal has always been Love in
    a Cottage! But as she was bent upon our marrying, I agreed to
    waive this objection.</p>

    <p>"In proof of this assertion I need only say that on the
    <i>very day after</i> our first meeting, I received the
    following letter:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"'PRICELESS AND ADORABLE PET,&mdash;How <i>are</i> your
    little tootsy-wootsicums? <i>Did</i> they get wet in conducting
    me home after that <i>delicious</i> interview? If so, and you
    were to catch cold in your precious head, I should never
    forgive myself. Oh, come and see me <i>soon!</i> Your Own, till
    Death, ANGELINA.'</p>

    <p>"Possibly I may be blamed for publishing this letter. I do
    it for <i>her</i> sake, not for mine. Even now I believe that,
    were I left alone with her for an hour, with none of her
    relatives nor a policeman near, I could persuade her to retract
    her calumnious statement about the poker. I conclude by saying
    that it is my belief that her relatives, who are all of them
    powerful mesmerists, have <i>hypnotised her!</i>"</p>

    <p><i>My Face is My Fortune</i>, by Messrs. PHILIPS and
    FENDALL. Why don't they agree to spell both names with an "F,"
    and make it FILLIPS and FENDALL. I fancy that FENDALL couldn't
    do without the sensational fillips. This story excites
    curiosity throughout the first volume, and then, in the other
    volume, satisfies it in so disappointing and commonplace a
    fashion as to suggest the idea that one of the authors,
    becoming weary of his share in the work, suddenly chucked it
    up, and said, "Oh, bother! let's finish anyhow;" and then the
    other <i>collaborateur</i>, whichever it was, did finish it as
    best and as quickly as he could. There is evidence of laziness
    or of lack of invention in the story. If it were for the first
    time in fiction that a secret is learnt by some one hiding
    behind some pantomime plants in a conservatory, then too much
    praise could not be bestowed on the ingenious devisers of so
    strong and original a situation. But as "we know that
    situation,&mdash;he comes from Sheffield," and as it has done
    duty some scores of times before, on or off the stage, why, the
    thoroughgoing novel-reader shakes his head and asks, "Couldn't
    they have devised something better than this between them?" "I
    expected much from this combination in Authorship, and am
    disappointed," says the candid BARON DE BOOK-WORMS.</p>

    <h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

    <h3>EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</h3>

    <p><i>House of Commons, Monday, April 27</i>.&mdash;"Well, I
    never!" said GEORGE ELLIOT, beaming on House from back bench;
    "have known HARCOURT man and boy for forty years; seen him in
    divers moods; watched him through various occupations. These
    have been so many that I have had time to forget he was once
    Chancellor of the Exchequer; but he was, and upon my word,
    listening to him to-night, and knowing something about figures
    myself, I believe he would have made a splash at the
    Treasury."</p>

    <div class="figleft"
         style="width:20%;">
        <a href="images/225.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/225.png"
             alt="Genial George." /></a>Genial George.
    </div>

    <p>JOKIM doesn't enjoy performance quite so much as GENIAL
    GEORGE. Oddly enough, Budget Night, which ought to be the apex
    of comfort and glory for CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER, is with
    him ever the season of tribulation. House of Commons is,
    regarded as audience, always at its best on Budget Night. Will
    laugh immoderately at feeblest joke uttered by CHANCELLOR;
    cheers to the echo his moral sentiments; sits enraptured when
    he soars into eloquence; and is undisguisedly grateful when he
    has completed his peroration. JOKIM'S muddle of Thursday night
    made the best of. Opposition silenced by promised legislation
    establishing Free Education. Everything in sunshine-glow of
    prosperity. Thought JOKIM might keep some of the sunbeams for
    himself. Then comes HARCOURT with the abhorr&euml;d shears of
    facts and figures, and slits the thin-spun web of JOKIM'S
    ingenious fancy; shows that, instead of a surplus, he has, when
    honest arithmetic is set to work, a deficit; instead of
    increasing the rate of reduction of National Debt, he has done
    less in that direction than his predecessors; and that whilst
    expenditure on Army and Navy has exceeded any figures reached
    by former Chancellors of the Exchequer, the floating debt is
    ever growing.</p>

    <p>JOKIM sits on Treasury Bench affecting the virtue of a smile
    though he has it not. Wriggles like a snail under dispensation
    of salt. When HARCOURT finished, HENRY FOWLER stepped in, and
    with fresh array of figures and new marshalling of argument,
    completed the demolition of JOKIM'S system of finance. Mr. G.
    looked smilingly on, delighting in the energy and aptitude of
    his Young Men. JOKIM, anxious to change the subject on any
    terms, tried to draw Mr. G. into the controversy. "I think
    not," said Mr. G., with a smile of ineffable sweetness. "Right
    Hon. Gentleman need not go so far afield: will have pretty
    tough job in answering HARCOURT."</p>

    <p>A pretty scene; admirable Parliamentary play. Oddly enough
    boxes empty; stalls a wilderness; pit only half full. Energies
    of House so sapped with dreary flood of talk on Irish Land Bill
    cannot be reanimated even for a brisk battle over the
    Budget.</p>

    <p><i>Business done</i>.&mdash;JOKIM pummelled to pulp.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday</i>.&mdash;OLD MORALITY walked out of House just
    now, his back suffused with sense of duty done, alike to QUEEN
    and Country. Irish Land Bill, which, as CAMPBELL-BANNERMAN
    says, makes a Moated Grange of House of Commons, on again all
    day. SAGE OF QUEEN ANNE'S GATE and his Party active as usual.
    The PARTY a little doubtful of the SAGE. Sometimes, in blessed
    intervals of silence, is discovered gazing on a bald space on
    back of SAGE'S head, striving, as it were, to pierce through
    this weak spot, and discover what is in the SAGE'S mind. The
    SAGE in outward manner most deferential and encouraging. Misses
    no opportunity of publicly applauding him. It is true that when
    the SAGE has got him on his legs, starting afresh on new
    Amendment, he seizes the opportunity to slink out of the House,
    and take another cigarette, quite certain that the PARTY is
    good for half-an-hour. This, and one or two other little
    things, create a suspicion in the mind of the PARTY, who was
    not brought up in India for nothing. WILFRID LAWSON, who sits
    close by, and keenly watches progress of events, says he has no
    doubt the time will come when the PARTY will revolt.</p>

    <p>"KEAY," says WILFRID, "occupies a strategical position,
    which gives him a great pull over LABBY. His respected Leader
    sits on the bench immediately below him. Some day SEYMOUR
    KEAY'S wild Mahratta blood may boil over, an unsuspected
    scimitar may flash forth from his trouser pocket, and the
    SAGE'S head, falling gory on the floor of the House, may
    gently, from mere force of habit, roll in the direction of
    Queen Anne's Gate."</p>

    <p>"For a real sanguinary-minded man," said RITCHIE, to whom I
    told this story, "give me a teetotaller."</p>

    <p>The PARTY, with some assistance from Windbag SEXTON, wasted
    sitting till quarter to seven. By this time, all Amendments to
    Clause 3 being wearily worn off, opportunity just left to pass
    Clause before Sitting adjourned. Question put that Clause 3
    pass. Then SAGE, smelling obtrusively of cigarettes,
    interposed, and declared it "would be indecent" to accept the
    Clause without further discussion. Nothing House shrinks from
    just now more abjectly than from charge of indecency.
    Accordingly debate stood over, and Thursday may, if the SAGE
    and his Party please, and the Closure is not invoked, be
    appropriated for further discussion of Clause 3.</p>

    <p>OLD MORALITY might have moved Closure at twelve minutes to
    seven, and carried Clause 3. Committee naturally expected he
    would. But OLD MORALITY had another card up his sleeve. At very
    last moment, whilst Members trooped out, and it was thought all
    was over, OLD MORALITY gave notice of motion to take the whole
    time of House, including Tuesday and Friday nights' evening
    sittings.</p>

    <p>"I think you had them there," I said, as we walked across to
    Grosvenor Place.</p>

    <p>"Yes, TOBY," he said, a little flush mantling his modest
    face; "we've given them rope enough, and now we'll hang them.
    They've had their run, now we'll take ours. It's the main thing
    I always look to. Never forget when I was still in the seminary
    writing out copy of verses about a shipwreck. A graphic scene;
    the riven vessel, the raging seas, the panic-stricken crowd on
    deck, and then this little self-drawn picture of the sole
    survivor, the one man left to tell the story:</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Some fell upon their bended knees</p>

            <p class="i2">And others fell down fainting,</p>

            <p>But I fell to on bread and cheese;</p>

            <p class="i2">For that, Sir, was the main thing.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>It's the bread and cheese I look to, TOBY, dear boy. For
    others the glory of debate, the prize of Parliamentary oratory.
    Give me the bread and cheese of seeing business advancing, and
    I'm content."</p>

    <p><i>Business done</i>.&mdash;Once more Committee on Irish
    Land Bill.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday</i>.&mdash;A pretty little game on to-night. OLD
    MORALITY moved his Resolution taking power to appropriate
    Tuesdays and Fridays evening sittings, and all Wednesdays for
    Irish Land Bill. In ordinary circumstances there would have
    been stormy protest led from Front Opposition Bench against
    this inroad on time of private Members. Other fish to fry
    to-night. Wednesday week assigned for Second Reading of Woman's
    Suffrage Bill; if Government take that day for Irish Land Bill,
    obviously can't be utilised for furtherance of Woman's Rights.
    This an awkward question for some Members; don't like it, but
    daren't vote against it. Here's opportunity of getting rid of
    it by side-wind. Not necessary in arranging proceedings to
    mention Suffrage Bill, or even Wednesday, 13th of May. It was
    principle for which Members struggled; "the principle of
    uniformity," as Mr. G. beautifully put it. "Let us," he said,
    though perhaps not quite in this phrase, "go the whole hog or
    none; take all the Wednesdays, or leave them."</p>

    <p>Pretty to see OLD MORALITY protesting against this
    unprecedented access of generosity. The very picture, as MCEWAN
    said, of a good man struggling with the adversity of
    overwhelming good fortune. Was prepared to take a Wednesday
    here and there: but, really, too much to appropriate everyone.
    "Not at all&mdash;not at all," said Mr. G.</p>

    <p>But it was only under compulsion of a Division that he
    consented to accept the endowment. In meanwhile, the Woman's
    Suffrage Debate on Wednesday week snuffed out, and final
    opportunity of Session lost.</p>

    <p>"I'm inclined," said WM. WOODALL, "as a rule, to take kindly
    views of my fellow men, to put the best construction upon their
    actions; but, upon my word, I'm not satisfied in my own mind
    that we advocates of Woman's Rights have not been made the
    victims of deep and dastardly design."</p>

    <p><i>Friday</i>.&mdash;Brer FOX looked in to-night, and,
    finding Brer RABBIT absent, undertook charge of Irish affairs.
    Desirous of introducing novelty into situation, began by
    patronising Prince ARTHUR. "So conciliatory, you know; so
    anxious to meet the views of Irish Members; really, they ought
    to meet him half-way, and refrain from annoying him by
    unnecessary Amendments."</p>

    <p>Brer FOX'S voice faltered as he spoke, and, bringing round
    his tail, he gently brushed away a falling tear. Unfortunately
    for him, TIM HEALY present. TIM jumped up, and fell upon his
    ancient chief, flouting his counsel, and repudiating his right
    to leadership. Effect upon Brer FOX something like that which
    followed on the flight of the piece of old red sandstone which
    struck in the abdomen a gentleman, who chanced to be standing
    round. The subsequent proceedings interested him no more. He
    walked out, and was not seen again. "Exceedingly rude man," he
    said; "never come near TIM HEALY but I feel an infinite
    yearning for a fire-escape." <i>Business done</i>.&mdash;Land

    exclaimed the Clergyman. Then, taking the Catalogue into his
    own hands, he read "<i>Return of Persephone</i>." "It's
    pronounced," he informed his help-mate,
    "P&euml;r-s[)e]ph-[)o]-n[)e]." "Is it?" she returned, in a tone
    expressive of unmitigated incredulity. "Then," she asked
    suddenly, as a brilliant idea struck her, "why isn't
    'telephone' pronounced 'tel-[)e]ph-[)o]-n[)e]'?" And turning

    <h3>THE RIGHTS AND WRONGS OF LABOUR.</h3>

    <p class="center">
    (<i>At the service of the Ch-nc-ll-r of the Exch-qu-r, if he
    purposes writing a Prophetic Romance.</i>)</p>

    <p>MACAULAY'S New Zealander had arrived prematurely. London
    Bridge was not reduced to its centre pier, and St. Paul's
    Cathedral was certainly not in ruins. Still there was an
    uncanny look about town. On the Embankment electric tram-cars
    were running, but they seemed to be little patronised. Here and
    there he noticed a pedestrian leisurely going his way, but the
    side-walks appeared, to all intents and purposes, abandoned. At
    length he reached a garden-seat, upon which was sprawling a
    Typical Working Man. The New Zealander gave this interesting
    individual "Good morning," and made some common-place remark
    about the weather.</p>

    <p>"Fine day!" returned the T.W.M., rather surlily. "Well, what
    does it matter to me? If it rains, I stay at home; if it don't,
    why I don't either."</p>

    <p>"I am a stranger seeking for information," explained the New
    Zealander; "so I am sure you will excuse me if I ask you how
    much do you pay for your house?"</p>

    <p>"Pay for my house!" ejaculated the T.W.M. "Why, nothing of
    course! And I pay nothing too for my sons at Oxford, and the
    girls at Cambridge. And I get my clothes free, and my food
    comes in gratuitously. Why, you must be a stranger if you don't
    know that! Why everything and anything is paid by the
    Government&mdash;out of the Income Tax."</p>

    <p>"And don't you ever work?"</p>

    <p>"Work! bless you, no. I can't afford to work! If I did, I
    should have to pay the Income Tax myself!" returned the T.W.M.,
    with a grin.</p>

    <p>"Then who does contribute to this evidently highly-important
    source of revenue?</p>

    <p>"Why, the professional men, under Schedule D!" cried the
    hardy son of toil. "The authors with families, and the City
    clerks. All <i>that</i> set, you know. They pay the Income Tax,
    sure enough. It's as much as they can do to keep bodies and
    souls together. But <i>somebody</i> must pay&mdash;why not
    they?&mdash;pay for themselves&mdash;and for me!"</p>
    <hr />

    <p>THE DUMB SHOW.&mdash;It sounds odd that the serious
    pantomime, <i>L'Enfant Prodigue</i>, the play without words,
    should be "the talk of London."</p>

    <p>"<i>George Hotel," Billsbury, Friday, April
    25th</i>.&mdash;Arrived this morning in order to attend a
    "Monstre Open Air Conservative F&ecirc;te, which was held in
    the grounds of the Billsbury Summer Palace. The programme was a
    very attractive one. First, there was a "reception of town and
    county delegates and their ladies" by the Earl and Countess of
    ROCHEVIEILLE. The Earl is a scrubby little fellow of about
    sixty, who looks more like an old-clothes-man than anything
    else. Norman noses&mdash;at least their descendants in this
    generation&mdash;are curiously like the Semitic variety
    sometimes. The name is pronounced "Rovail," and both the Earl
    and Countess get blue with rage if anybody makes a mistake
    about it, as nearly all the delegates did. They stood on a
    raised da&iuml;s, and received delegates' addresses to the
    number of about thirty. Lady ROCHEVIEILLE is a stout
    lady&mdash;very. It was a blazing hot day, and she was
    "overcome" just as she was shaking hands with Colonel and Mrs.
    CHORKLE, who were accompanied by BENJAMIN DISRAELI CHORKLE. The
    rest of the CHORKLE family, including WILLIAMINA HENRIETTA
    SMITH CHORKLE, who was in a nurse's arms, were somewhere about
    the grounds looking for the "Magic Haunts of the Fairy Bulbul,"
    and eating enormous quantities of macaroons, which I had given
    them. Colonel CHORKLE rather lost his head when Lady R.
    collapsed. He made an effort to pick her up, but had to drop
    her heavily on the boards of the da&iuml;s. Eventually,
    however, she was carried away and revived, and the proceedings
    went on. There were Conservative merry-go-rounds, Conservative
    negro-minstrels, Conservative acrobats and Conservative dancing
    bears, distributed about the grounds. I was taken about by
    Alderman MOFFAT and HOLLEBONE, who introduced me right and left
    to hundreds of my supporters and their wives and daughters. At
    the end of it all I felt as if I had got a heavy sort of
    how-do-you-do smile regularly glued on my face. One of my chief
    supporters is an undertaker named JOBSON. HOLLEBONE brought him
    up to me and said, "Mr. JOBSON, permit me to introduce you to
    our popular young Candidate, Mr. PATTLE. Mr. PATTLE let me have
    the honour of introducing you to our popular young undertaker,
    Mr. JOBSON." Gave me rather a shock, but JOBSON seemed quite a
    pleasant man. His wife was there too, gorgeously dressed in red
    plush with an Indian shawl on her shoulders, and a sealskin
    muff. She must have felt the heat horribly.</p>

    <p>Later in the afternoon there was a political meeting, at
    which we all spoke, but we had to make it short, as everybody
    was anxious to get away to the "Refined Musical
    <i>M&eacute;lange</i> (with incidental dances) of the Sisters
    WILKINS," which was held in a specially erected tent.
    Fireworks, illuminations, and dancing, ended the affair.</p>

    <p><i>April 26</i>.&mdash;Was made an Oddfellow to-day.
    Initiation didn't last long. CHORKLE and JERRAM were initiated
    with me, and we all had to make speeches afterwards, declaring
    our devotion to the great cause of Oddfellowship. Afterwards
    sentiments were called for. The only one I remember was given
    by a man called TABSEY, a tailor, who seems to be rather famous
    for this kind of thing. After holding his hand to his head for
    some time, and knitting his brows, he cleared his throat, and
    said, in a loud voice,&mdash;"May the tear of true sympathy
    crystallise as it falls, and be worn as a radiant jewel upon
    the finger of affliction." This was vociferously applauded. I
    congratulated TABSEY afterwards, and paid him a compliment
    about it. He told me he found it a great relief, after a hard
    day's work in the shop, to throw off a sentiment or two. He's
    going to publish a book of them, and I've had to subscribe for
    six copies, at half a guinea each.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>FROM A WATCHFUL OBSERVER.&mdash;SIR,&mdash;The other day I
    saw advertised in a shop-window, "The Invisible Trouser
    Stretcher." Who wears "Invisible Trousers"? Do you remember the
    story of <i>The Emperor of China's Clothes?</i>&mdash;when they
    all cried, "He's got 'em on," and he hadn't. That Invisible
    Trousers should exist is quite enough stretch of imagination
    without any further stretcher.&mdash;Yours, THE DAY
    WATCHMAN.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>MRS. R. AT THE OPERA.&mdash;Mrs. RAMSBOTHAM Junior went to
    hear <i>La Traviata</i>. She expressed her sympathy with
    <i>Violetta</i>, between two <i>Gourmands</i>. Remarking on the
    touching finish to the converted <i>Traviata's</i> career, Mrs.
    R. observed that it reminded her of the poet's line about "She
    who stopped to cough, remained to pray."</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
